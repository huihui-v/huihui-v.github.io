Hey, thanks for stopping by! 👋

My name is Jian-fei XING (邢劍飛 in Chinese). I am a M.Phil student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn). I was advised by [Prof. Ruixuan WANG](http://www.isee-ai.cn/~wangruixuan/) and [Prof. Wei-shi ZHENG](https://www.isee-ai.cn/~zhwshi/).

I'm interested in Computer Vision, Medical Image Analysis and Adversarial Robustness in Deep Learning systems. My ongoing project is focused on application of robust features in medical images.

I'm currently looking for Ph.D positions.
